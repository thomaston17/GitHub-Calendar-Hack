# Usage

Clone this repository and `cd` into it on your computer. Next run `chmod 755 graph.sh` to make the shell script executable 
and than run `./graph.sh <commits per day> <how many days back>` to create all of the fake commits. cd into the new directory
with `cd commits_hack`. Create an empty repository on github and do `git remote add origin <repo url>.git`. Then all you 
have to do is run `git push origin master` and you will look like a very badass GitHubber!
